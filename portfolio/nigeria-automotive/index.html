            Nigeria Automotive Market Analysis for Tsuyomi Motors
          </h1>
          <div class="site-project-single-description">
            <h3 id="10-introduction">1.0 Introduction</h3>
<p>Tsuyoi Motors (強い車) is an international car-dealing organisation seeking to break into the Nigerian automotive market with a focus on recently manufactured cars. However, they are faced with multifaceted problems. To address these problems, they require a thorough analysis of whether the business should focus on selling new or used cars, the potential for the selected car condition cars in the market, the popular vehicle makes preferred by Nigerians, recommended makes and models, the recommended average price range, and an examination of variables associated with pricing.</p>
<h3 id="20-dataanalysis">2.0 Data Analysis</h3>
<p>Given the aforementioned problem, a dataset (dated 2021) on the listing of cars in Nigerian automotive markets was used. The dataset included information on the make, year of manufacture, transmission, condition, and price of each listed car. By analysing this data, certain information and relationships valuable to Tsuyoi Motors (強い車) could surface.</p>
<p>Firstly, in the Nigerian automotive market, the most popular cars appear to be Toyota, Honda, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz, with the most popular among these quartet being Toyota vehicles. In addition to this, it could be seen that automatic vehicles were more popular among Nigerians. It would make sense to sell cars from these makes that are only automatic in transmission. This is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

         alt="Figure 1: Frequency of cars per make in Nigeria." width="100%"/><figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another look at Figure 1 shows that Nigerian used cars are more popular among Nigerians, especially Toyota cars. A scatter plot on the relationship between prices over the years reveals more details:</p>
<figure><img src="images/figure_2.png"
         alt="Figure 2: Scatter plot showing a positive correlation between prices and year of manufacture of cars." width="100%"/><figcaption>
            <p>Figure 2: Scatter plot showing a positive correlation between prices and year of manufacture of cars.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is a positive correlation between the year of manufacture and the price of cars. Aside from this, it can be deduced that for recently manufactured cars, Nigerian used cars are more popular among Nigerians however at lower prices. Regardless, there is room for sales of foreign used cars (see Figure 3 below) whose prices are pegged higher than those of Nigerian used cars. Specifically for foreign used cars with newer models, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Honda, Land Rover, and Lexus are popular among Nigerians (See Figure 2 above).</p>

         alt="Figure 3: Count of cars listed by year of manufacture following a normal distribution." width="100%"/><figcaption>

</figure>

<p>From the above, there is room for Tsuyoi Motors (強い車) to market foreign-used cars in Nigeria and should do so given that it is convenient for them to source foreign used cars as an international company.</p>
<p>Considering the makes Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Honda, Land Rover, and Lexus; it is best to narrow the vehicles to those who sell close to the median price of the cars. The median price of cars in the Nigerian automotive market is given as 2,310,000 Naira for Nigerian-used and 4,200,000 Naira for foreign-used ones i.e. Foreign-used are 82% more expensive than Nigerian used. In narrowing the makes, it is best to pick brands that sell close to the median. From Figure 4, Toyota and Honda would be easily sold in the Nigerian market for foreign-used cars.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The average Nigerian foreign-used car lover would be comfortable with buying Toyota and Honda makes compared to Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus. However, the latter group could be targeted at Nigerian locations with high purchasing power. For the general population, it is better to go with Toyota and Honda cars.</p>

<p>Furthermore, while Engine Size does not affect the price of cars as shown in Figure 5, Tsuyoi Motors (強い車) should introduce cars with lower engine sizes circa 2500 cubic centimetres as shown in Figure 6.</p>
